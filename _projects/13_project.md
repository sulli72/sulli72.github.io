    A shock train interaction occurring in a low aspect ratio rectangular duct with a Mach 2.0 inflow
</div>

This investigation builds upon the study of shock train unsteadiness in a low aspect ratio duct.
By parametrically varying the duct aspect ratio from 0.82 to 1.00 to 1.20, subtle changes in interaction structure are revealed.
Shock train topology, similarity parameters, and scaling of the coherent mid-band shock train flapping modes are all considered, all of which present vital design information for hypersonic propulsion systems.
