Shock trains within non-square ducts display different statistics on the lateral and vertical walls.
This project investigates not only what these differences are using high-fidelity simulation, but why these differences occur.
By parsing dynamics into select frequency ranges, we can further demonstrate in a scale-by-scale manner what unsteady features change when either the top and bottom or side walls are considered.
