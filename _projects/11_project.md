In this work, the dynamics of a shocked transonic diffuser are investigated.
Inflow mach number and outlet pressure are carefully chosen such that a single normal shock arises in the diverging portion of the nozzle, where the Mach number is locally transonic (M~1.4) in nature.
The geometry of the problem is symmetric, meaning flow separation occurs on both the top and bottom walls in the vicinity of the normal shock.
Future efforts will consider the inherent instabilities and sensitivities of this system, and ultimately seek to manipulate the position and orientation of the normal shock using active control methods.
