    A single normal shock impinging on a turbulent boundary layer. Coherent turbulent structures, identified by an iso-surface of the velocity vector Q-criterion, are easily identifiable in the image. Furthermore, these structures undergo fundamental changes as an adverse pressure gradient acts on them as they convect beneath the shock wave.
